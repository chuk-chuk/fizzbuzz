##Â FizzBuzz

This is an introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD) by the way of solving a classic programming problem FizzBuzz
We use RSpec is a testing tool for the Ruby programming language.

## Objective

The objective of Fizzbuzz is to create a program with the following specification:

1. The program can be passed a number.
2. When passed a number that is a multiple of 3, the program returns the message 'Fizz'.
3. When passed a number that is a multiple of 5, the program returns the message 'Buzz'.
4. When passed a number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the program ignores the previous 2 rules and returns the message 'Fizzbuzz'.
5. In all other cases, the program simply returns the given number.

## How to Run an RSpec Test Suite

run `rspec`

RSpec then executes the Ruby code within `_spec.rb` file.
